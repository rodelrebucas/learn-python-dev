## Design pattern samples

### Summary:

#### _Creational patterns_ are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms and are used in situations when basic form of object creation could result in design problems or increase complexity of a code base.

#### _Structural design_ patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realise relationships between entities or defines a manner for creating relationships between objects.

#### _Behavioral pattern_ explains how objects interact. It describes how different objects and classes send messages to each other to make things happen and how the steps of a task are divided among different objects. Where Creational patterns mostly describe a moment of time (the instant of creation), and Structural patterns describe a more or less static structure, Behavioral patterns describe a process or a flow

### Anti patterns means:

- Immobile - very hard to re use
- Rigid - small changes leads to many changes in every places
- Fragile - changes can easily break existing system
- Viscose - changes are done in the code or environment to avoid difficult architectural level changes

### Kinds of anti pattern in development

- Spaghetti code - no OOP design and poor architecture

- Golden Hammer - a familiar solution to all problem without considering whether it suits the need.

- Lava flow - dead/unneccesary codes

- copy/cut pasting code - snippets used to move quickly in the development, results in similar issues from the snippets

### Kinds of anti pattern in architecture

- Reinventing the wheel

- Vendor lock in - glued/dependent/revolves around on the technology given by their vendors where changes are difficult

- Design by committee - solution given by a group of people
  that are often complex and substandard, because of many thought process
