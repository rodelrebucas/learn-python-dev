## Design pattern samples

### Summary:

#### _Creational patterns_ are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms and are used in situations when basic form of object creation could result in design problems or increase complexity of a code base.

#### _Structural design_ patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realise relationships between entities or defines a manner for creating relationships between objects.

#### _Behavioral pattern_ explains how objects interact. It describes how different objects and classes send messages to each other to make things happen and how the steps of a task are divided among different objects. Where Creational patterns mostly describe a moment of time (the instant of creation), and Structural patterns describe a more or less static structure, Behavioral patterns describe a process or a flow
