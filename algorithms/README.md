Algorithm analysis - tells the behaviour of an algorithm as input grows in terms of time and space complexity

Terms:

- Asymptote - a line in a graph of a function approaches but never reaches.
- Asymptotic - an Asymptote behavior

- Time complexity - how long does algorithm takes to finish as input grows

- Space complexity - how much space does algorithm needed as input grows

Big O - Asymptotic upper bound / worst case,

- Finding the Big O

1. Find the fastest growing variable.
2. Eliminate co-efficient and constants.

   Why?

   - we only care how the algorithm behaves in terms of bigger inputs

   - it has minimal effect on the result.

Big Omega - lower bound / best case

Big theta - contains lower bound and upper bound / average case.
